SQL Queries for Tableau Dashboard

This script contains the four main SQL queries used to prepare datasets for Tableau visualizations. 
The queries were executed in Google BigQuery and exported as CSV files, which were then uploaded 
to Tableau Public to build an interactive COVID-19 dashboard.

Each query focuses on a different perspective of the data:
1. Global total cases, deaths, and calculated death percentage
2. Total death count by continent (excluding global aggregates)
3. Highest infection counts and population infection percentages by country
4. Daily progression of infection rates by country
