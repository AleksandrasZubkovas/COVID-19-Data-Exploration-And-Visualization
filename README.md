# COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL

The dataset used in this project comes from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), which provides up-to-date COVID-19 statistics. The data used was accessed via BigQuery and includes global COVID-19 case, death, population, and vaccination figures from March 2020 to June 2021.

## Key Highlights:
- Analyzed infection and death rates relative to population
- Used **window functions** and **CTEs** to track cumulative vaccinations
- Identified countries and continents with highest case and death rates
- Created temporary tables and views for structured analysis
- Exported cleaned data into **Tableau** for data visualization

### Interactive Dashboard:
