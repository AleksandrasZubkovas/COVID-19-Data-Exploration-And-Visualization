/*
Project: COVID-19 Data Exploration

This project involves exploratory analysis of a COVID-19 dataset that includes global statistics on cases, deaths, and vaccinationsâ€”organized by country and continent over time.

Key SQL skills demonstrated:
- Joins and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Temporary tables
- Window functions
- Aggregate functions
- View creation
- Data type conversions

The goal is to extract meaningful insights and prepare data for visualization and further analysis.
